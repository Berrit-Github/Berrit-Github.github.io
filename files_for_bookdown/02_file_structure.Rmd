# repository mapping

An important skill to have when using code and github is making a structured mapping system. 
For a working structure there are a few rules to help.

* dived the work into projects.

* add a README to all the files which explains what the file contains and how it should be looked ad.

* separate, data, reports, the raw_data and the final analysis etc. so each can easily be found and looked at.

underneath Is an example of my own made mapping structure

```{r}
fs::dir_tree("bookdown_gallary/daur2_tidy_data")
```
