# CV

This page contains my CV , This CV was created on Rstudio and has a Rmd file wich you can find here https://github.com/Berrit-Github/Berrit-Github.github.io/blob/main/bookdown_gallary/reports/_CV_for_port.Rmd

Due to bookdown and the used template used for the cv aren't compatible the best way to show it is through a include graphs code used below.

```{r cv, echo=F, out.width="100%", out.height="1500"}
knitr::include_graphics('bookdown_gallary/reports/CV_for_port.pdf')
```

The template used for my cv can be found on this github page
