# easy IC50 plotting package

Rstudio is a great platform for data analysis and storing, with the gigantic amount of packages that can be obtained through github and other platforms is the variation immensely big. To contribute to this I have made my own R package with this R package data for IC50 analysis can easily be downloaded, altered and plotted. 

To download this package you need the devtools package with the code beneath it can be loaded into Rstudio.
To see the vignettes of this package browsevignette() can be used 
```{r eval=FALSE, }
devtools::install_github("Berrit-Github/easyIC50plotting" , build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

You can also see my package on my github
