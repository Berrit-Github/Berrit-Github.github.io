  {"id":"rieuLeucineSupplementedMealFeeding2003","abstract":"Acute leucine supplementation of the diet has been shown to blunt defects in postprandial muscle protein metabolism in old rats. This study was undertaken to determine whether the effect of leucine persists in a 10-d experiment. For this purpose, adult (9 mo) and old (21 mo) rats were fed a semiliquid 18.2 g/100 g protein standard diet during the 8-h dark period for 1 mo. Then, each group was given either a leucine-supplemented meal or an alanine-supplemented meal (as the control meal) for 1 h and the standard diet the rest of the feeding period. On d 10, rats were fed either no food (postabsorptive group) or the supplemented meal for 1 h. Muscle protein synthesis was assessed in vivo 90–120 min after meal distribution using the flooding dose method (1-13C phenylalanine). Leucinemia was similar in rats of both ages in the postabsorptive state. Postprandial plasma leucine concentrations were one- to twofold greater after the leucine meal than after the control meal. In the postabsorptive state, leucine supplementation did not modify the muscle protein synthesis rate in old rats but enhanced it to the postprandial rate in adult rats. As expected, muscle protein synthesis was stimulated by the control meal in adult rats but not in old rats. The leucine meal restored this stimulation in old rats but did not further stimulate muscle protein synthesis in adult rats. In conclusion, the beneficial effect of leucine supplementation on postprandial muscle protein anabolism persists for at least 10 d. The long-term utilization of leucine-rich diets may therefore limit muscle protein wasting during aging.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Rieu","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Sornet","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Bayle","given":"Gérard"},{"family":"Prugnaud","given":"Jacques"},{"family":"Pouyet","given":"Corinne"},{"family":"Balage","given":"Michèle"},{"family":"Papet","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Grizard","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Dardevet","given":"Dominique"}],"citation-key":"rieuLeucineSupplementedMealFeeding2003","container-title":"The Journal of Nutrition","container-title-short":"The Journal of Nutrition","DOI":"10.1093/jn/133.4.1198","ISSN":"0022-3166","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1198-1205","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Leucine-Supplemented Meal Feeding for Ten Days Beneficially Affects Postprandial Muscle Protein Synthesis in Old Rats","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622157494","volume":"133"}
